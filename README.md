# React Dictionary
React Dictionary is a dictionary application created using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/) API.

The demo application is hosted [here](https://ubaniabalogun.github.io/react-dictionary/)

It was written to reinforce lessons learned from the [React JS Fundamentals course](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/p/reactjsfundamentals) created by [Tyler Mcginnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33).

Feel free to fork the repository for your own learning.

Note: This [file](https://github.com/ubaniabalogun/react-dictionary/blob/master/app/helpers/secrets.js) in the repository includes an API key to the Wordnik API. It's the same API key used in the Wordnik API documentation page. Feel free to change it to yours.
